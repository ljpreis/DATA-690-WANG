### Issue of Interest: Baltimore City
Baltimore city is my issus of interest. Specifically I have questions surrounding vacant houses. It is an issue that everyone notices. You cannot drive around in the city and notice all of the houses in disrepair. A Washington Post headline from October 2019 reads *Baltimore is furiously knocking down vacant houses â€” but barely keeps up as new ones go empty*, the article by Ian Duncan details Baltimore's strugle and the barriers to getting ahead.
One thing Ian Points out is that Housing Commissioner Michaerl Braverman said that by 2020 the total count of vacant houses would tally below 15,000 for the first time in 15 years. They were not able to reach that goal because more vacant homes popped up. Interestingly enough Bravemen comments that not all of theses houses were in distressed areas.
### Why is this issue of interest to you and others
This issue is of interest for a few reasons:
- Houses slated in desrapair can be bought for cheap and some contractors may be interested in good leads for houses that can be flipped
- The city is interested in reducing the number of vacant houses because of their effect on crime.

### What questions would I like to answer
1. I would like to see if there is any value that can be created, or investment oppourtunity identified by combining map data, vacant house data, and real estate data?
    
### Where do you get the data to help answer your questions
much of the data is publicly avaible on balrimore city.gov or kaggle
- https://data.baltimorecity.gov/widgets/qqcv-ihn5
- https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/zillow-house-price-data

### What will be my untit of analysis
My unit of analysis will be vacant houses, I will observe more than 16,000 vacant houses in Baltimore using currnet data.
### What measures do I plan to use
I plan to use geographical measures and real estate data to analyze the vacant houses
### What techniques do you plan to use
I plan to use summary statistics do identify the houses with the highes upside in terms of investment. I can also do the opposite and identify houses that can be slated for destruction.
